# 🎤 DNN Speech Recognizer: Turning Babble into Text! 🚀

## **Welcome to Project Introduction!**
Welcome, dear reader, to a journey where we transform the cacophony of sound into articulate text! In this epic quest, we’ll harness the power of deep learning to build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline. Ready your neural networks—let’s dive into the world of LibriSpeech! 📚🎶

## **Project Overview**
This notebook is your magical portal to creating a deep neural network that listens to raw audio and whispers back transcribed text! You’ll begin by extracting features from audio (like a sorcerer extracting potions from mystical herbs) and then proceed to construct models that can actually *understand* what is being said. Along the way, you’ll encounter mind-bending research papers and awe-inspiring GitHub repositories. 🧙‍♂️✨

## **Step-by-Step Guide to Victory!**
- The tasks for this project are outlined in the vui_notebook.ipynb in three steps. Follow all the instructions, which include implementing code in sample_models.py, answering questions, and providing results. The following list is a summary of the required tasks.

### **Step 1: Feature Extraction – The Beginning of the End**
Our journey begins with the LibriSpeech dataset, where we’ll extract features from raw audio. Execute all code cells like a wizard casting spells to uncover hidden gems of information! 

- **Action**: Run the magical code snippets to extract audio features. These features are like the secret ingredients for our speech recognition elixir! 🍹🎤

### **Step 2: Acoustic Model – Setting Up the Environment**
Now that we have our features, it’s time to build our acoustic models. We’ll construct various models and pit them against each other in an epic showdown! 

- **Action**: Implement the code for Models 1, 2, 3, and 4 in `sample_models.py`. 
- **Training**: Train each model for at least 20 epochs—because what’s better than a well-trained model? Nothing! 😄🏋️‍♂️
- **Comparison**: Execute the comparison code and engage your brain cells to answer Question 1 about model performance. 🧠💡

### **Step 3: Decoder – Implementing the Spell!**
With our models ready, it’s time to decode the magic of speech. Run the prediction code and watch as your models turn audio waves into text! 🌊➡️📜

### **Criteria for Models**
- **Model 0: RNN**: Train for at least 20 epochs. Store weights in `model_0.h5`. 
- **Model 1: RNN + TimeDistributed Dense**: Same as above, but with added magic! ✨
- **Model 2: CNN + RNN + TimeDistributed Dense**: Time to create a powerful hybrid! 
- **Model 3: Deeper RNN + TimeDistributed Dense**: Because deeper is better, right? 
- **Model 4: Bidirectional RNN + TimeDistributed Dense**: Let’s go both ways! 

### **Step 4: Heuristic Implementation – Why Did It Work?**
This is where we analyze why different models might shine brighter than others. Answer Question 1 with the enthusiasm of a child on a sugar rush! 🍭🤪

### **Step 5: Experiments & Results – Graphing My Sanity**
Plot the results like a true data artist! Visualize your findings and see which model reigns supreme! 📈👑

### **Step 6: Final Model – The Grand Finale**
For your ultimate masterpiece, design a final model that’s unique and glorious! Train it for at least 20 epochs and store the weights in `model_end.h5`. Answer Question 2 about the architecture with the flair of a seasoned bard! 🎭📖


## **Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!**
1. **Add a Language Model**: Supercharge your decoder with a language model. Create your own or find one that’s been blessed by the coding gods! 🛠️🔮
2. **Train on Bigger Data**: Go big or go home! Use larger datasets to see how well your model performs under pressure! 📦💪
3. **Try Out Different Audio Features**: Experiment with spectrograms or MFCC features. Feeling adventurous? Train on raw audio waveforms! 🌊🎧

## **Conclusion**
Congratulations! You’ve traversed the winding path of deep learning, from chaotic audio to coherent text. Embrace your newfound skills and prepare to dazzle the world with your speech recognition prowess! 🌍✨

##Just remember — even the mightiest programmers start with baby steps (and occasional tantrums). And hey, sometimes those baby steps mean seeking help from fellow coders, dissecting their code, and piecing together solutions. So yes, I’ve had my fair share of peeking into others' projects, learning from their work, and figuring out how things tick. It’s all part of the journey. So, maff kar do muja if I borrowed an idea or two along the way—because, in the end, it’s about growing and improving. 😅
